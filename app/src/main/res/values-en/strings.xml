    <string name="desc_back_disable">Some watches (e.g. MiTu) enable swipe-right-to-go-back by simulating the back button. Enable this switch if accidental swipes exit pages during left/right navigation.\n\nNote: Enabling will disable back-button exits on other devices, and may cause interface freezes after swipe-back gestures.\nUse the Exit button at the bottom menu to close the app.\nMost users can keep this off.</string>
    <string name="desc_cover_play_enable">Enabling this option changes tapping the cover on the video details page from viewing the image to starting playback. By default, the setting is determined by whether you first tapped the video cover or the play button during initial use.</string>
    <string name="desc_img_stop_load_while_scrolling">Enable this option to prevent images from loading during list scrolling—they\'ll only load after you stop.\nThis may affect visual smoothness but could improve scrolling performance.</string>
    <string name="desc_img_request_jpg">Some generic-brand watches and devices with extremely low Android versions lack WEBP format support,\nwhich could lead to unloaded images.\nEnabling this option forces JPG format requests to resolve this,\nthough loading may take slightly longer.</string>
    <string name="desc_async_inflate_enable">Enabling this option will implement asynchronous loading for specific pages\n(displaying a loading animation until content fully renders).\n\nNote: Activating asynchronous loading may occasionally trigger crashes,\nwhile disabling it could make some pages appear frozen during loading,\nresulting in suboptimal experience. Please configure according to your needs!</string>

    <string name="desc_showonline">The built-in player\'s bottom-right corner displays the real-time viewer count\nfor videos, or shows historical viewers and entry alerts during live streams.\n\nIf playback crashes midway, you can try toggling off this feature.\n\nThis functionality is exclusive to the built-in player.</string>
    <string name="desc_scale">During video playback, use photo-viewing gestures to zoom and pan,\ndouble-tap the screen to reset size.\n\nFor single-touch devices: Double-tap and keep holding on the second press,\nthen drag vertically to zoom.\n\n! If zooming fails, toggle the [Display Mode] option below! \n\nSpecial thanks: Liangwan Player</string>
    <string name="desc_doublemove">Optimized for large-screen devices,\nwhile potentially causing usability issues on smartwatches.</string>
    <string name="desc_display">! If encountering video playback glitches/crashes/unresponsiveness/zoom failure,\ntry toggling this option!\n\nKnown issues: KidoX3 works only with Surface mode,\nXiaotiancai requires Texture mode,\nand some devices need Texture mode for zoom functionality.</string>
    <string name="desc_videocodec">Hardware Decoding: GPU-powered processing,\nfast speeds with minimal energy consumption\n\nSoftware Decoding: CPU-driven computation,\nbroader compatibility &amp; winter hand-warming bonus</string>
    <string name="desc_audiocodec">Stick with AudioTrack for regular use.\nIf encountering audio delay or playback failure, try switching modes.</string>
